# Stock Prediction Flask Website

Welcome to the **Stock Prediction Flask Website** repository! This project is a web application that uses machine learning to predict stock prices. It is built with Flask and provides an interactive platform for users to explore stock trends and predictions.

## Project Highlights

### 1. **Machine Learning Model**
- Developed a predictive model trained on historical stock market data.
- Incorporated advanced algorithms to forecast stock prices with accuracy.
- Optimized the model through feature selection and hyperparameter tuning.

### 2. **Web Framework: Flask**
- Built using Flask, a lightweight and efficient web framework.
- Enabled seamless integration of the predictive model with the web interface.

### 3. **Interactive User Interface**
- Designed a clean and intuitive interface for users to input stock details and view predictions.
- Visualized stock trends using charts and graphs for better data interpretation.

### 4. **Real-time Insights**
- Provides real-time stock predictions based on the latest data.
- Offers insights to assist in making informed financial decisions.

## Why This Project Stands Out
- **Practical Application:** Demonstrates the use of machine learning in the financial domain.
- **Educational Resource:** Serves as a learning tool for students and enthusiasts in data science and finance.
